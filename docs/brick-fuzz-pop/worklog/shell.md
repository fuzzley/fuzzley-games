# Work log: Brick Fuzz Pop, shell stream

The shell stream's log of
[`implementation-plan.md`](../implementation-plan.md)'s U3 to U6, split off
the view and shell stream so they run beside V1 to V4: what each package
built, where it went other than planned and why, what the checks reported,
each review comment and what became of it, and the numbers worth keeping.

## Part 2

### U3: the settings

**2026-11-10.**

**What was built.** `src/app/settings/`, from Asteroid Breaker's and Brick
Breaker's, standing alone for U1 to place:

- `settings.service.ts`: `SettingsService`, a `storedSignal()` under
  `brick-fuzz-pop-settings`, version 1, holding `Settings`: `aiming`
  (`Aiming`, one of `AIMINGS`: `byPointer`, `pullBack`, `pointAndHold`),
  `flightSpeed` (`FlightSpeed`, one of `FLIGHT_SPEEDS`: `normal`, `fast`),
  `speedUpLongFlights`, `guide` and `sound`, the three on by default, as
  "Controls" lists them. Its reader takes each stored field that makes
  sense and the default for the rest, as the breakers' do; `update()`
  changes the fields given.
- `settings.component.{ts,html,scss}`: `<app-settings>`, inputs `open`,
  output `closed`, in `<fz-settings-drawer>`: Aiming and The flight's speed
  as `<fz-choice-list>`s, each choice its name over a few words; Speed up
  long flights, Show the aim guide and Play sounds as checkboxes, each with
  a line beneath; and `<fz-theme-picker>`. Each applies at once.
- Specs: 7 for the service (the defaults, a partial change, the next visit,
  a field that doesn't read, a way of aiming and a speed it doesn't know, a
  field kept before it was offered, another version), and 28 for the
  component, by role, against the real service and a store in memory.

**Choices the plan didn't make.**

1. **The settings' types live in the service,** as Asteroid Breaker's
   `DECK_SHOWINGS` do, since neither the view's steering (V2) nor its
   timing (V4) exists yet to hold them, and the shell may not be imported
   by the view. So `Aiming` keeps the setting's three choices, and U1
   resolves `byPointer` to pull back for a finger and point and hold for a
   mouse before handing V2's steering a way per pointer; and U1 turns
   `FlightSpeed` into V4's units a second (14 and 22 in the plan). If V2 or
   V4 names either type, the service can take theirs instead.
2. **No `GameService`.** Brick Breaker's and Asteroid Breaker's settings ask
   the game to start a run at a new speed. Here nothing the drawer offers
   is the run's: the rules decide a round as it is released, whatever the
   flight looks like, so every choice applies at once and the component
   needs only `SettingsService`. U2's debug menu, which does need the game,
   comes into this drawer later, as it does in the breakers.
3. **Aiming's choices are `By the pointer`, `Pull back` and
   `Point and hold`,** "By the pointer" the default: decision 15's "a
   setting picks the touch or the mouse's way for either". A line beneath
   says the keys aim either way.
4. **The flight's speeds are worded without their numbers,** and "Speed up
   long flights" without its 8 seconds, since those are V4's numbers and Q3
   tunes them; the words can read them once V4's `timing.ts` exists.
5. **The stylesheet takes `@fz/game-ui/toolkit` by its namespace,**
   not `../styles` taken whole as the breakers' do: the shell's
   `styles/_index.scss` is U1's and doesn't exist yet, and
   `frontend/AGENTS.md` takes `*` only for an app's own toolkit. The
   integrator is asked for the one-line file; once it lands, the line
   becomes `@use "../styles" as *;`.
6. **The specs keep one setting off its default at a time** as the drawer
   opens, so a checkbox bound to another setting shows that one's and
   fails.

**Checks.** The workspace's `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and
`test:coverage` pass: 462 tests in 14 files, 35 of them new; both new files
at 100% of statements, branches, functions and lines. The root's
`yarn lint` passes.

**The mutation pass.** 41 mutants, one at a time, each run against the
settings' specs: the key and the version; the lists' order and length; each
default; `update()`'s order; each field's reader (from any value, from
another field, never, falling back to another value); the choices' names
and words; each handler doing nothing, setting another field, or always
clearing or always ticking; each binding pointed at another field; the
aiming list's description; Close; and the theme picker. Of the first 39,
37 were killed at once. One survivor got specs: the guide's box always
clearing, as only the sound's box had a spec ticking it again. Each box
now has one, from its setting kept off, and they killed the two mutants
added with them, long flights' box always clearing and the guide's always
ticking. One is equivalent: the reader refusing a stored `byPointer`, the
default it falls back to. The review's specs were mutated too: five
mutants, each list's and box's description pointed at another's and the
speeds' details swapped, all killed.

**The review:**

1. **Four of the five descriptions had no spec,** nor the speeds' details,
   so a control described by another's line passed. Fixed: a spec for the
   speeds' description and each box's, and the speeds' details pinned as the
   aiming list's are; their five mutants are in the mutation pass.
2. **"Keeps the way in use when it is pressed again" couldn't fail,** as
   nothing here guards a choice pressed again, unlike the breakers' speed.
   Fixed: dropped.
3. **`@use "@fz/game-ui/toolkit" as *` breaks the rule that takes `*` only
   for an app's own toolkit.** Fixed: the stylesheet takes it by its
   namespace, and the integrator is asked for `src/app/styles/_index.scss`
   (the fifth choice).
