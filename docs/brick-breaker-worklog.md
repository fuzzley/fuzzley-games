# Brick Breaker: the work log

Where the build of Brick Breaker stands, step by step, as
`docs/brick-breaker-execution-plan.md` runs it: what each step built, the
choices it made, its checks, its review and what became of each finding,
and the QA checkpoints. Newest last.

## 2026-10-29: the plan

- **Plan.** The user took all 21 of the design plan's recommendations and
  asked for a plan of execution, with a work log, regular commits, QA
  checkpoints, and an independent review after every commit whose findings
  are answered in a commit of their own. `docs/brick-breaker-execution-plan.md`
  holds it, with the design folded in as "Design reference";
  `docs/brick-breaker-plan.md` is deleted.
- **Choices.** B0's mock is no longer a gate: the look is shown to the user
  in screenshots at Q3 and Q4 instead, and its spike's questions are
  answered on the real code at Q2 and Q3. Part 2's branch is cut from Part
  1's tip rather than from `main` after a merge, so nothing waits on one.
  Nothing is pushed or merged into `main` without the user's go-ahead.
- **Branch.** `brick-breaker-lift`, cut from `main` at `c0220468`.
- **Numbers to compare against.** Snake's entry chunk is 77.7 kB gzipped,
  its scene 4.0 kB and its `phaser` chunk 351.7 kB (from the design plan).
